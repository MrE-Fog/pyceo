Bugs and Caveats
================

CEO:
    - curses does not draw borders/lines correctly in a screen session. screen apparently ignores
      some font-changing characters. workaround should be possible (other progs work).
    - the menu is not redrawn between windows and therefore a gap tends to grow there
